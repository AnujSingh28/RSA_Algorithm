# RSA_Algorithm
Python code to implement public key cryptography RSA algorithm on Charm-Crypto framework.

1. RSA_doctest.py tests algorithm on some default inputs to check the functioning of parameters.
  command to run in the terminal: python3 RSA_doctest.py -v
2. RSA_custom_input takes custom input from the user and gives encrypted as well as decrypted form of message given.
  
  Note: Installation of Charm framework is required for code to work properly.
